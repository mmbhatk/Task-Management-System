This is a simple To-Do application implemented using:
-HTML
-CSS
-Express Framework
-Angular JS
-Bootstrap
-MongoDB

When an item is added to or removed from the to-do list, it updates the same in the MongoDB database. Hence, the contents of the to-do list remain the same despite refreshing the page.

Steps to run the application:

1. Start the node server using: node index.js
2. Visit localhost:5000/ on the browser.
3. Add/remove items to/from the list.
4. Refresh the page. The contents of the list are not lost.
